## Design Patterns Implementation

### Singleton Design Pattern

- **Description**: In my calculator project, developed within a Repl environment, I employed the Singleton design pattern to effectively manage my application's configuration. Think of it as having a trusted advisor that ensures all configuration settings remain consistent and allows only one instance to exist at any given time. This approach promotes reliability and helps me avoid configuration conflicts.
  

## Usage of Environment Variables

- **Description**: I extensively utilized environment variables in my calculator project to maintain configuration settings and sensitive information separate from my codebase. This approach enhances security, flexibility, and portability, allowing me to easily customize settings based on different environments (such as development, testing, and production) without modifying the code. 


## Logging Implementation

- **Description**: Logging was able to track application changes, errors, and debugging information. I configured logging to output messages to various destinations such as the console and log files, ensuring visibility into the application's behavior. By utilizing logging levels and custom formatting, I organized and presented log messages in a structured and informative manner, facilitating troubleshooting and maintenance.
